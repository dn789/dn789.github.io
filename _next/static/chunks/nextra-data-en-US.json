{"/posts/corpus_analysis":{"title":"Corpus Analysis Tool","data":{"":"This is an in-development, Qt-based application for quick analyses of arbitrary text corpora (currently supports JSON, HTML, XML and CHAT [CHILDES] formats).All the user has to do is select the corpus folder, identify the relevant file type(s), and annotate a representative corpus file to highlight the nodes/keys representing the text content and any metadata of interest.The app will then automatically process the corpus into a sentence-tokenized SQLite database, enabling keyword and topic search, filtering by meta values, plotting, etc.The next steps in development are (1) filling out the (currently barebones) analysis suite and (2) automating the preprocessing. The latter step will involve using an LLM to identify the text and metadata content in the corpus files automatically, then letting the user confirm/edit the LLM's selection."}},"/posts/l2_english_corpus":{"title":"L2 English corpus from Reddit","data":{"":"This is a tool for automatically generating a corpus of second-language (L2) English from Reddit posts for a variety of native languages (L1s).You'll need a Reddit account to access the API (authentication instructions here).The tool is intialized with a dictionary associating L1s to a list of subreddits with speakers of that language (e.g. if I want a corpus of L2 English by German speakers, I'd add subreddits like r/de and r/austria to the config). It uses the Reddit API to get comments from users who post/comment in those subreddits. If a user has a sufficient number of comments in the L1, some of their English comments are added to the corpus for that L1."}},"/posts/peer_review_helper":{"title":"Peer Review Helper","data":{"":"This is an LLM-assited tool for copy-editing pentest reports."}},"/posts":{"title":"Posts","data":{}},"/":{"title":"Home","data":{"":"Posts about linguistics/NLP, etc.\nGitHub @dn789Email nassre@gmail.com"}},"/papers":{"title":"Papers","data":{"--speech-segmentation-and-word-discovery-parser#- Speech Segmentation and Word Discovery: PARSER":"","--null-subjects-in-child-english-qualifying-paper-1#- Null Subjects in Child English (Qualifying Paper 1)":""}},"/tags/[tag]":{"title":"Tagged Posts","data":{}}}
